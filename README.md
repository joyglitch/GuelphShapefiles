# GuelphShapefiles

## Description
This repository is a simple demonstration of how to use shapefiles in Python with [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/). The result of this program is a map of Guelph, Ontario with outlines of roads & railways, parks, rivers, buildings, and bus stations/stops located within the city. The shapefiles used are obtained from [BBBike](https://www.bbbike.org/).

## Demo It Yourself
To try the model yourself, you must enter your own Twitter API authorization codes and clone the repository by entering:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joyglitch/GuelphShapefiles.git
```
Then, run the `mapNotebook.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
